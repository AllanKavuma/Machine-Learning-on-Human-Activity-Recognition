## Executive Summary
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal was to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

The report describes how the model was built, how cross validation was used, the expected out of sample error, and reasons for the choices made. The prediction model was used to predict 20 different test cases.
